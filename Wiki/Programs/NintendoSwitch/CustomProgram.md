# Custom Program

This is a template for writing your own programs. To build your own program, you can start by editing this one. Then rename it later.


## Instructions

There are 4 files to each program:

- `CustomProgram.c` - Settings for the program.
- `Programs/CustomProgram.h` - Header for settings.
- `Programs/CustomProgram_Core.c` - The program itself.
- `GeneratorConfig/NintendoSwitch/CustomProgram.json` - Information needed to be included in the HexGenerator.

All programs actually have all 4 files. The `_Core.c` is not publicly available for most of them, but it is for CustomProgram so you can make your own program.

The file `Programs/CustomProgram_Core.c` contains a very simple program that mashes the A button. Use this as a starting point.
