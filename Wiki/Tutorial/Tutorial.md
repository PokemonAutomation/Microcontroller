# Microcontroller Tutorial for Microcontroller-Only And Computer-Controlled Programs

This is the entry point for setting up a microcontroller to control your Switch.
You must start here regardless you choose microcontroller-only or computer-controlled programs.

## Before you Continue

Before you begin, make sure **you have a computer.** This used to go without saying, but it's becoming apparent that many people do not have computers anymore and only have phones or tablets. You need to have a Windows, macOS or Linux laptop/desktop computer (or a high-end Windows tablet) that you can install software on it.

Due to lack of developer, our support of Mac and Linux is limited.
While you can set these programs up on Mac and Linux, you will need to know how to run command-line build scripts.

### Requirements for Computer-Controlled Programs

If you would like to use computer-controlled programs, make sure you meet all of the following requirements:

1. You have computer running 64-bit Windows or macOS. As of this writing, no other platforms are supported. But if you use Linux, you should be computer-savvy enough to adapt our macOS guide to work for your Linux. 
2. You have a regular Switch (not a Switch Lite) if you want to use most of the computer-controlled programs (i.e. programs requiring video/audio feedback).
3. Be willing to spend an additional $20 - $50 USD for the new hardware.
4. Your computer must be sufficiently powerful:
- If you intend to control **1** Switch: A dual-core processor @ 3 GHz no older than 2015 should be sufficient.
- If you intend to control **2** Switches: A quad-core processor @ 3 GHz no older than 2015 should be sufficient.
- If you intend to control **4** Switches: 6-8 cores minimum.
